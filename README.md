cab's ploopy mods
====

This repo contains several of my small projects aimed to make Ploopy Headphones more comfortable for me — and maybe for you too.

They are mostly in dense OpenSCAD.

## [Newcap](./newcap/)

Stock magnet holders (driver caps) are not optimized for volume output.
This model improves volume dramatically (20dB+) by tweaking distance to the driver, magnet alignment and openness.

## [Headband](./headband/)

Ploopy headband is comfortable, but is not fit for listening on the move.
This model sits tighter — tight enough to  ride on an electric scooter — yet is still comfortable enough to enjoy.
